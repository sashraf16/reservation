1. reservations array will always be in numeric order (a sort can eventually be added to make sure that it is)
2. the rule of "zero 1 night gaps" has been upheld, i.e., it will not check for existing reservations
3. every transaction will only involve 1 month at a time, i.e., the start and end dates requested by the user, as well as the dates that are already reserved will
    all be in the same month
4. transactions will be between the 3rd, and 3rd last day of the month. This is because currently the app checks for -2 and +2 days for the month. The 1 month 
    assumption is that all data (existing reservations and desired reservations) will take place in the same month
